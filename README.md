# 🌤️ Smart Weather App — Geolocation + Network + Canvas APIs

A beginner-friendly, fully responsive React app that fetches live weather data based on your location, detects your network type, and visualizes weather conditions using the HTML Canvas API. This project was built as part of an assignment to demonstrate the usage of **3 real-world Web APIs** — `Geolocation API`, `Network Information API`, and `Canvas API`.

## 📋 Assignment Overview

**Task:**  
Build a frontend application that solves a real-life problem using at least 3 of the following Web APIs:
- Geolocation API => (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)
- Canvas API => (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)
- Network Information API => (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Network_Information_API)

**Project Goal:**  
Create a weather-based application that:
- Gets user’s **location**
- Detects **network type**
- Visualizes **weather** conditions with dynamic graphics
